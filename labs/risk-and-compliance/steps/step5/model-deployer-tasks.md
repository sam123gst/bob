Please access this [Guide](./model-deployment.md) if you want to actually perform those task on watsonx, otherwise ask one of the instructor to perform the technical tasks for your behalf or just skip this step (you can upload a faulty dataset to simulate an incident later on). As a **AIOps Engineer**, you are still responsible to document your deployment on the Governance Console. See Deployment Responsabilities below:
